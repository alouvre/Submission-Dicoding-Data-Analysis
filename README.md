# Bike Rental Data Analysis

## Introduction

The data set in question provides comprehensive information about bike rentals over the course of two years (2011 and 2012). The data is categorized by various factors such as time (year, month, hour), weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed), and user type (casual or registered). This report aims to analyze this data, focusing specifically on the daily data, to identify patterns and correlations that could provide valuable insights for business development.

## Categorization

The data can be categorized into several groups:

- Time-related:
  This includes the year, month, and whether the day is a holiday or working day.
- Weather-related:
  This includes the weather situation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- User-related:
  This includes the count of casual users, registered users, and total rental bikes.

## Theme Identification

Several themes can be identified from these categories:

- Seasonal Trends:
  How do bike rentals vary across different seasons and months?
- Weather Impact:
  How does weather affect bike rentals?
- User Behavior:
  What are the differences between casual and registered users in terms of rental patterns?

## Correlation

We will examine the correlation between these categories to understand how they interact with each other:

- Is there a correlation between weather conditions and bike rentals?
- How does the time of year affect the behavior of casual versus registered users?
- Does the type of day (holiday vs working day) impact bike rentals?

## Business Questions

Based on these themes and correlations, we can formulate several business questions:

- How can we optimize bike availability according to seasonal trends?
- Can we predict bike rental demand based on weather conditions?
- How can we better cater to the needs of both casual and registered users?
